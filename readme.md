### Problem Statement
Due to digital payments and credit cards, people tend to spend a lot more than they expected. Develop an application which helps users view and study their
overall spend analysis using the purchase history or scanning the receipt.

### Approach
- Design a PWA for better accessibility
- Enable easy user-onboarding
- Allow user to add expenses (Manually/OCR)
- Visualize userâ€™s expenditures and other metrics via the application
- Enable user to set reminders
- Segregate expenses in categories
